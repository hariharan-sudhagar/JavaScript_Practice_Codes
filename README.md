These are my javascript practice code which majorly focused on syntax , fundamental stuff and some data structures like
(map,set,array,strings).
Soon i will post another repo or in this same repo with advanced concepts like CALLBACK , CALLBACK HELL, HOISTING, CLOSURES,PROMISES, ASYNC WAIT
and Asynchronous Programming...

For this Practice session, I used w3schools and some articles.
